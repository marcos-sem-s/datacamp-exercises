## ETL compared to ELT
In the last video, you learned how ELT (**E**xtract, **L**oad, **T**ransform) compares to the ETL (**E**xtract, **T**ransform, **L**oad) process we've discussed throughout the course. In this exercise, show your understanding of the differences between the two processes. Organize the different features of each process into the correct category.

**Instructions**

Place the statement about ETL and ELT processes in correct bucket.

> Congratulations on identifying the differences between ETL and ELT processes. While each has similar steps, it is crucial to understand the strengths of each approach.
