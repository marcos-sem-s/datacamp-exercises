## Ordering data warehouse layers
In the recent video, you learned of the different architectural layers common in data warehouses. Data flows from input sources to users for analysis through these different layers.

**Instructions**

Place the different stages in order.

1. Source layer
2. Staging layer
3. Storage layer
4. Presentation layer

> You did a great job of placing the layers in order. Each layer is dependent on all the layers before it. Therefore, challenges with the source layer, such as bad data, will affect all other layers.
