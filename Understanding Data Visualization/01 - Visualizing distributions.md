Motivating visualization
To get an insight from a dataset, you can calculate summary statistics or run statistical models, but often it's easier to draw a plot.

In this exercise, you can see the price of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency from the start of 2016 to the start of 2020. Columns in the table are filterable and sortable.

Look at the Bitcoin prices on January the first each year. Which year began with the highest Bitcoin price?

## Continuous vs. categorical variables
In order to choose an appropriate type of plot to draw, you need to be able to distinguish between continuous variables (roughly: "things you can do arithmetic on") and categorical variables (roughly: "things that can be classified").

**Instructions**

State which of these variables are continuous and which are categorical.

| Continuous | Categorical |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Salary of employees | Was the exam passed or failed? |
| Population of towns in Canada | Job title of employees |
| Mass of squirrels | Provinces of towns in Canada |

> Classy classification! The distinction between continuous variables (numbers) and categorical variables (text) is important when deciding what kind of plot to draw.
