# Introduction to FastAPI
This course teaches you to build production-grade web applications using FastAPI, a popular Python framework for creating APIs. You'll learn to handle all four HTTP operations, define request and response schemas, validate API requests, and return appropriate HTTP status codes. You'll also cover asynchronous code execution to boost performance, and by the end, you’ll develop a CRUD API and test workflows with Python's requests module. Tailored for experienced Python programmers, this course equips you with the skills to manage data with FastAPI, preparing you to build robust data management and ML model-serving pipelines.

## FastAPI Basics
We’ll start by learning FastAPI’s key features and core use cases. Then we will run our first application and test it out! Finally, we will learn the details of supporting GET and POST operations that include request parameters and build and test those endpoints.

## FastAPI Advanced topics
We’ll start by learning how to support PUT and DELETE operations using FastAPI. Then we will learn how to handle different kinds of errors and always return an appropriate status code in the response. Lastly we'll learn how to use async to enable concurrent requests that can handle higher workloads.

## Building and testing a JSON CRUD API
We'll start by learning how to write system tests to validate individual FastAPI endpoints. Next we'll build a full JSON CRUD API to manage object lifecycles over HTTP. Finally, we'll learn how to test different application endpoints working together with manual functional tests.
