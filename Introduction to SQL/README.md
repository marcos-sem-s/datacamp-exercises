## Relational Databases
Before writing any SQL queries, it’s important to understand the underlying data. In this chapter, we’ll discover the role of SQL in creating and querying relational databases. Using a database for a local library, we will explore database and table organization, data types and storage, and best practices for database construction.

## Querying
Learn your first SQL keywords for selecting relevant data from database tables! After practicing querying skills in a database of books, you’ll customize query results using aliasing and save them as views so they can be shared. Finally, you’ll explore the differences between SQL flavors and databases such as PostgreSQL and SQL Server.
