# Introduction to Testing in Python
Plenty of people write code. Some of them make it work and profitable. But sometimes, even the smartest of the best programmers makes a mistake that can cost millions of dollars. How to decrease the possibility of getting into such a fiasco? How do you ensure that you create a program that does exactly what you want? The very simple answer is: write tests!

During this journey, you will learn the very basics of creating tests in Python. You will meet four types of software testing methods. You will create your own tests to check if the program or a data pipeline works as expected before it goes to production. Whether it is the unexpected null, a typo in your dataset, or mixed-up signs in the equation. You can, and you will catch those cases with the tests.

After the course completion, you will know the types of testing methods, and you will be able to choose the most suitable ones for a specific context. You also will be able to design those tests and implement them in Python using the pytest and the unittest libraries.

## Creating Tests with pytest
Learn what a test is and how to run the first one of your own with the pytest library! You will get used to the pytest testing framework and the command-line interface. You will also learn how to process specific contexts, like "failed tests" and "skipping the test" with pytest markers.

## Basic Testing Types
Learn what the basic testing types are and their features. Learn about test cases and how they help to implement tests. You will get more skilled with creating test functions and running pytest from CLI in IDE exercises. Finally, you will be able to differentiate the different testing types and create tests for each of them.

## Writing tests with unittest
In this final chapter, you will meet the unittest framework. First, you will learn basic assertion methods, then its CLI interface, and how to use fixtures. Finally, you will put everything together in the practical examples of data pipelines.
